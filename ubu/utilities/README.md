`ubu/utilities`

This subdirectory is for miscellaneous utlities that do not fit neatly into any other top-level subdirectory.

Such functionality might include things we wish were a standard, but are not.

Some examples:

* `ceil_div`
* `constant`
* `integral_like`
* `constant_valued`
* `tuple_like`
